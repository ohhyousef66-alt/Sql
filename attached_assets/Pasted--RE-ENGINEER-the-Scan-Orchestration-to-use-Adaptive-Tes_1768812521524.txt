"RE-ENGINEER the Scan Orchestration to use 'Adaptive Testing' instead of fixed limits. The goal is Mass-Scanning efficiency.
1. Adaptive Multi-Stage Pipeline:
Discovery Stage: Use the Playwright crawler to identify all entry points.
Heuristic Probing (The Filter): Instead of a fixed number, send a 'Representative Sample' of diverse polyglot payloads (covering strings, integers, and brackets).
Smart Decision Logic: If the heuristic probes show Zero Deviation (no change in response time, DOM structure, or error codes), terminate the scan for that parameter immediately to save resources.
Deep Dive: Only trigger the full 'Global Payload Repository' if a Heuristic Hit is confirmed.
2. Dynamic Concurrency & Connection Scaling:
Remove hardcoded thread limits. Implement a Self-Scaling Worker Pool.
The engine should increase concurrency as long as the 'Success Rate' is 100%. If the server starts throwing 429 (Rate Limit) or 503 (Overload), the engine must automatically throttle down until stability is restored.
3. Intelligent Payload Sequencing:
Re-order the payload execution based on Historical Success Rate. The engine must prioritize 'High-Confidence' payloads (like the Boolean-blind one that worked on Scan 44) at the start of every session.
Implement Early Exit on Confirmation: Once a vulnerability is confirmed with 100% confidence, immediately stop testing that parameter and move to the next.
4. Resource-Efficient Discovery:
Configure Playwright to block all non-essential assets (Images, Fonts, CSS, Trackers) to maximize bandwidth for SQL payloads.
Use 'Headless-First' mode with a fallback to raw HTTP for simple pages to maintain maximum RPS (Requests Per Second).
5. Progress Telemetry (Dynamic Calculation):
The UI must calculate progress based on the Current Work Queue Size vs Completed Tasks, updating in real-time as the crawler finds new links.
Directive: Focus on 'Coverage-per-Hour' as the primary metric. The engine must be 'aggressive' but 'smart' enough to not waste time on secure endpoints."
