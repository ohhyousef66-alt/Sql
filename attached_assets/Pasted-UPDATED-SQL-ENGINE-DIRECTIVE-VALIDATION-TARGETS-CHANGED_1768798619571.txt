UPDATED SQL ENGINE DIRECTIVE – VALIDATION TARGETS CHANGED

This instruction supersedes any previous validation requirements
that reference testphp.vulnweb.com.

==================================================
1. MANDATORY SQL VALIDATION TARGETS (UPDATED)
==================================================
The scanner must be validated ONLY against the following targets:

1) https://hackazon.webscantest.com/
2) https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/

These are intentional vulnerable test environments.
Both contain multiple SQL injection vectors.

The scanner MUST detect SQL injection on BOTH targets.
Failure to detect SQLi on either target is a FAILURE of the engine.

Do NOT treat "no vulnerabilities found" as a valid outcome on these targets.

==================================================
2. SCAN COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
==================================================
For BOTH targets:
- The scan must reach 100% completion.
- The scan must not freeze, stall, or terminate early.
- The scan must exercise all SQL payload classes:
  - Error-based
  - Boolean-based
  - Time-based (if needed)

A scan completing in under 2 minutes with no findings
is considered INVALID by design.

==================================================
3. SQL ENGINE DECISION LOGIC (MANDATORY CHANGE)
==================================================
The SQL engine must make a DECISION.

It is NOT acceptable to:
- Detect signals
- Then suppress them
- Then report nothing

Decision rules:
- Repeatable DB error behavior → SQLi (CONFIRMED)
- Stable boolean structural difference → SQLi (CONFIRMED)
- Consistent timing deviation → SQLi (LIKELY)

Detection comes FIRST.
Verification and confidence refinement come AFTER.

==================================================
4. AGGRESSIVE SQL MODE (REQUIRED)
==================================================
Introduce or enforce an Aggressive SQL mode for validation targets.

In this mode:
- Any repeatable SQL error is sufficient for detection.
- Any consistent boolean difference is sufficient for detection.
- Confidence scoring may be lower initially, but detection MUST occur.

Silence on known vulnerable targets is unacceptable.

==================================================
5. FAILURE HANDLING
==================================================
If SQL injection is NOT detected on either target:
- Assume the engine logic is incorrect.
- Refine detection thresholds.
- Re-run the scan automatically.
- Repeat until SQLi is detected consistently.

==================================================
FINAL RULE
==================================================
These targets are NOT optional benchmarks.

The SQL engine is considered functional ONLY when:
- SQL injection is detected on BOTH Hackazon and Juice Shop
- Scans complete fully
- No freezing occurs
- Results are repeatable across runs
