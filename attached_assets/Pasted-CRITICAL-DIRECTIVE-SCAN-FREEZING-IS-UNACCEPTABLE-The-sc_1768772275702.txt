CRITICAL DIRECTIVE – SCAN FREEZING IS UNACCEPTABLE

The scanner is STILL experiencing freezing and incomplete scans.
This is now a BLOCKER and must be resolved before any further feature work.

Do NOT stop execution, iteration, or refactoring until ALL freezing issues are eliminated.

==================================================
1. FREEZING – ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY
==================================================
The scanner must NEVER freeze, hang, or stall under any condition.

Mandatory actions:
- Identify all blocking async paths.
- Eliminate shared mutable state across workers.
- Enforce hard timeouts on:
  * every HTTP request
  * every SQL probe
  * every scan phase
- Add a global watchdog that forcibly terminates stuck tasks.
- Ensure task cancellation and cleanup is always executed.

If a parameter, payload, or phase exceeds its time budget:
- Abort it
- Log it
- Continue scanning

A scan reaching 99% and freezing is a FAILURE.
A scan must ALWAYS reach 100%, even if degraded.

==================================================
2. SQL ENGINE – CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODE
==================================================
The SQL engine must continuously refine itself until it is:
- Stable
- Fast
- Repeatable
- Deterministic

If SQL injection is missed:
- Assume engine failure
- Improve logic
- Re-test
Repeat until resolved.

==================================================
3. MANDATORY SQL VALIDATION TARGETS
==================================================
The scanner MUST be tested against ALL targets below.
SQL injection must be detected on EVERY target.
Scans must reach 100% completion on ALL of them.

Test targets (intentional SQLi labs):

3) https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
4) https://hackazon.webscantest.com/
5) http://demo.testfire.net/
6) https://demo.dvna.me/
7) http://zero.webappsecurity.com/
8) http://vulnweb.com/
9) https://public-firing-range.appspot.com/
10) https://owasp-skf.gitlab.io/asvs/

Acceptance rules:
- SQL injection must be detected on ALL applicable endpoints.
- Confidence must be consistent across re-runs.
- No scan may freeze or terminate early.

==================================================
4. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================
Speed must improve through ENGINE LOGIC, not shortcuts.

Required:
- Early rejection of non-injectable parameters
- Aggressive negative caching
- Intelligent escalation only when signals exist
- High concurrency for safe probes
- Serialized execution for time-based SQL

Never:
- Reduce verification
- Skip confirmation
- Downgrade confidence thresholds

==================================================
5. MULTI-TARGET SCANNING (TEMPORARY RULE)
==================================================
Multi-target scanning must NOT cause freezes.

Until architecture is fully safe:
- Run targets in isolated scan contexts
- No shared scanId
- No shared storage
- No shared task queues

If multi-target causes instability:
- Disable it
- Do NOT allow it to affect single-target stability

==================================================
6. COMPLETION GUARANTEE
==================================================
A scan is considered successful ONLY if:
- It reaches 100%
- SQL injection is detected where expected
- No freezes or deadlocks occur
- Results are repeatable

==================================================
FINAL INSTRUCTION
==================================================
Do NOT stop working until:
- Freezing is completely eliminated
- All test targets scan to 100%
- SQL injection is detected reliably on all of them

This is not optional.
Stability and correctness are mandatory.
