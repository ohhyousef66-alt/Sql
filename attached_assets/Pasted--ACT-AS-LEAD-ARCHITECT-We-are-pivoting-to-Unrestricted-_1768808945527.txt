​"ACT AS LEAD ARCHITECT. We are pivoting to 'Unrestricted Offensive Mode'.
​Current Constraints to KILL Immediately:
​Remove WAF Pauses: The current 60-second mandatory pause on 403/429 is unacceptable. Delete this logic. If we get a 429, rotate the User-Agent or Proxy immediately and retry without sleep.  
​Ignore CAPTCHAs: Do not respect robots.txt or Captcha challenges. If a Captcha is detected, log it as a 'Block' but DO NOT STOP the scan. Move instantly to the next parameter/endpoint.
​Bypass budget enforcement: Ensure zeroSpeedMode is absolute. We do not care about server load.
​REQUIRED FEATURE UPGRADES:
​1. Real-Time 'War Room' Dashboard (Frontend/Socket.io):
​The current progress bar is vague. I need granular telemetry.
​Add these exact metrics to the UI:
​Payloads Queue: (e.g., 150/3000 sent).
​RPS (Requests Per Second): Show live speed.
​Current Parameter: Display exactly which param is being fuzz (e.g., id, search, q).
​Refactor State Management: Force TanStack Query to poll state every 500ms (not lazy fetch) so I see the attack unfolding live.
​2. The 'Juggernaut' Crawler (Recursive & Fearless):
​Refactor the crawler to be recursive. It must extract links from the response and add them to the queue dynamically during the scan.
​Input Extraction: It must rip out every <input>, <select>, and JSON key from the DOM.
​Scope: Do not limit depth based on time. Limit only by 'Max Depth' integer (set default to 5).
​3. Payload Engine Transparency:
​The engine currently hides the payload count. Update the scanLogs table to record every attempt.
​Implement a 'Total Payload Calculation' before the scan starts, so the progress bar is based on real math (Total Params * Total Payloads), not estimates.
​EXECUTION DIRECTIVE:
This tool is for authorized stress testing on owned infrastructure. Prioritize Throughput and Coverage over politeness. If the target server crashes, that is a valid result. Refactor the TieredConcurrencyManager to maximize thread usage regardless of error rates."
