"ACT AS A SENIOR CYBERSECURITY ARCHITECT. We are upgrading SecScan.io to 'Elite Status'. Every update must prioritize DEPTH and BYPASS over speed.
1. Out-of-Band (OOB) SQLi Logic (The DNS Exfiltrator):
Implement DNS Exfiltration modules for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
When Error-based and Time-based signals are weak, the engine must attempt to trigger a DNS lookup (e.g., using LOAD_FILE or UTL_HTTP) to an external collaborator domain to confirm the injection.
2. Context-Aware Payload Orchestration:
Pre-Scan Fingerprinting: Send 3 'Probe Payloads' to identify the DB type and the injection context (e.g., is it inside a ', ", ), or a raw integer?).
Tailored Selection: Once the context is identified, the engine must ONLY use payloads from the Global Payload Repository that match that specific context to minimize unnecessary requests and WAF triggers.
3. Advanced DOM Structural Differential:
Upgrade the Boolean-Blind module. Instead of simple text/size comparison, it must perform a DOM Tree Hash comparison. If a specific HTML node (like a <div> or <span>) disappears or changes its structure, mark it as a high-confidence hit even if the page size remains identical.
4. Header & Hidden Parameter Fuzzing:
Expand the crawler to identify and test HTTP Headers (User-Agent, Referer, X-Forwarded-For) and Hidden Input Fields.
Any value that might be logged into a database must be treated as a primary injection point.
5. Professional WAF 'Shredding' Suite:
Enhance the 15 Tamping Strategies. Implement 'Dynamic Tamping' where the engine rotates encoding (Hex, Base64, URL-double) and obfuscation (Comment-injection /**/, Case-folding sElEcT) based on the detected WAF signature.
6. Statistical Confidence Engine:
For Time-based attacks, use a 5-sample baseline with a 3σ (Three-Sigma) threshold to filter out network noise. Never report a Time-based hit unless it is mathematically confirmed to be a server-side delay.
7. Deep Recursive Discovery:
The crawler must use Playwright to execute JS and find 'Deep Links' (e.g., links generated after a button click or a JSON response).
UI Requirement: Display a 'Live Payload View' showing the exact SQL command currently being attempted and its 'Confidence Score' in real-time."
