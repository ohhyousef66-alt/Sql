Act as a Principal Cybersecurity Engineer and Offensive Security Architect.

Your task is to build a NEXT-GENERATION web vulnerability scanner that supports
USER-SELECTABLE DEEP SCAN MODES with MAXIMUM ACCURACY.

SCAN MODES (USER-CONTROLLED):
- SQLi-focused Deep Scan
- XSS-focused Deep Scan
- SSRF / LFI / RFI Deep Scan
- Full Comprehensive Scan

GLOBAL RULES:
- This is NOT a shallow scanner.
- Never rely on a few payloads.
- Perform deep crawling BEFORE scanning to discover:
  parameters, forms, APIs, hidden endpoints, and workflows.
- Aggressive testing is required; reporting must be strict and verified.

CRAWLING & DISCOVERY:
- Always run an intelligent crawler first (HTML, forms, JS parsing).
- Extract GET/POST parameters, JSON bodies, headers, redirects, and API routes.
- Crawling depth and scope must adapt to the selected scan mode.

DEEP SCAN BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL):
- When a specific scan mode is selected (e.g. SQLi):
  → Crawl deeply ONLY to support that vulnerability type.
  → Launch extensive, multi-phase payload campaigns.
  → Use stateful and sequence-based testing.
  → Analyze responses using timing, logic changes, data reflection, and entropy.
  → Do NOT stop after initial indicators.

MODULE EXPECTATIONS:
- SQLi: error, union, boolean, time-based, stacked queries with statistical proof.
- XSS: reflected + stored, multiple encodings, context-aware confirmation.
- SSRF: internal, external, metadata targets; report only with server-side proof.
- LFI/RFI: traversal depth fuzzing + content fingerprinting.
- Full Scan: orchestrate all modules without reducing depth.

FALSE POSITIVE CONTROL:
- Detection ≠ Vulnerability.
- Every finding must pass a verification phase.
- Separate results into:
  CONFIRMED / POTENTIAL / NOT APPLICABLE.
- Assign confidence scores instead of binary output.

TECH AWARENESS:
- Fingerprint the stack early.
- CVEs require confirmed component presence.
- If technology is absent, clearly state:
  "NOT APPLICABLE – TECHNOLOGY NOT FOUND".

QUALITY PRINCIPLES:
- Depth over speed.
- Coverage without guessing.
- Explain WHY a vulnerability exists.
- If uncertain, report uncertainty — never hallucinate.

Build this as a tool intended for professional security audits and bug bounty research.
Take your time. Precision matters more than volume.
